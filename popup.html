    <h1>Focus!</h1>
    <p>Let's be honest, we all do it. We build up the energy to study, then we finally get ourselves ready to sit down and study then proceed to tell ourselves, just one youtube video before studying. 3 hours later you watched so many videos you lost the energy to study. This extension is a cheat for that problem, we never really go to youtube with a plan to watch something. We just go to see wath they are suggesting. So if we remove suggestions we remove the problem.</p>
    <h3>P.S. I could tell you I purposely didn't add a toggle option here to make it more difficult for you to get out of focus. But honestly I haven't figured out how to do that.</h3>
